They are part of compensation plans and used to retain employees and senior executives.These shares are purchased by employees at price below market price, or in other words, a discounted price.  
The employee gets access to the stock after he or she has fulfilled certain job-related conditions, such as performance-related goals or staying with the company for a set duration.
