For me expectations are a very beautiful and luxurious feeling and keeping it low and to limited people makes it more relevant and precious.

We usually expect from the people who are truly special and important to us to that very moment.

Sometimes they meet our expectations which gives us a feeling that "yes we know them', this gives us some kind of comfort and satisfaction.

Sometimes they exceed our expectations which gives us feelings of overwhelm, joy,happiness and somewhere deep down in our heart we feel like we are important to them.

But there are times when they don't meet our expectations, so instead of getting too hurt and sad about this we can do at least two things, first let them know about your expectations or lower down your expectations. When we express our expectations to them which is doable and if the person acknowledges it,then out of love , respect or affection that person will definitely try to meet your expectation for that moment or the next time. Second, lower down your expectations because it might happen that you raise the standard of your expectations too high that either that person can't meet it or that person is not worthy enough.

In my opinion, always Expect!

It gives you hopes, dreams, happiness, sadness, anger, dissatisfaction, all those feelings which are attached or come with your expectations.

And if you have feelings that means you are alive and there are some people out there who are keeping you alives.

And YOU matter.

So for me, if somebody who is truly important and special to me to the period of time or say in that phase of my life, expect from me I will definitely try to fulfill those told and untold expectations.

Being special is also a special feeling.

So this is in your hand,

* From whom you want to expect?
* What do you want to expect?
* And the most important level of your expectation - HIgh or Low.

Nobody has the right or obligation to tell you what you should do with your Expectations.

Keep Expecting!
