We all remember the stuff we do for the first time but do you ever remember the day when you were giving your last school test, having your last lunch with your best friends, scoring your last basket in a basketball ring or last shot on the cricket ground?

Last time you got late for your school, stood according to your height in assembly, reciting last morning prayers. Last time you wore your school's summer or winter dress. (_Now I can assure you that all you are imaging now is your uniform dress colour, your assembly area, your standing position, and morning warmth of those winter days with that smoke coming out of your mouth_)

Last time to treat your teacher with “_Gooooooooooooood Morning Ma’am” (I know you are singing the same in your mind now)_ when they gave their great entrance in your class. Last time when you were waiting for your name call during attendance. Last time when you forget to complete your homework and now you are finding brand new excuses for it. Last time when you were shocked by a surprise test and got passing marks that are just on line (_8/20_). Last time when you were fighting hard to not to fall asleep after that lunch break. (But you somehow manage to take a quick nap).

Last time when you celebrated _“Friendship Day”_ in your school, you had that one best band for your best teacher and best friend. _(You probably don’t remember all those different colour beats bands and no. of bands you got those days, but you remember that one person who is always there with you on every friendship day)_. Last time you saw your teacher on whom you had a crush or a girl or boy who was your crush/love, who might be your first one in the list.

Last time you participated in March past, school drill, sang that National Anthem for the last time.

The last time you participated in some competition and stood last or winning that golden small trophy or stood somewhere in between, who really cares now. Last time you dance on that National Patriotic Songs _(Yaa that “meri desh ki dharti” one)_ or dress up for Republic Day and Independence Day.

How can you forget about Last time we tease somebody with their funny nickname or inventing a teacher's Nickname?

Last time you were punished because of your friends or got your name written on black board by your class monitor. Last time when your seniors scold you just for fun. Last time you visited your favourite spot in your school, which is only for your group.

How can somebody forget about bunking classes, entering into that one and only AC room “Computer Lab” and terror room “Staff Room”?

I know you are now into the ocean of your school memories.

Those people who you grew up with, now you don't even know where they are, not even heard about them. _(Probably just witnessing their wedding stories on Insta.)_

But when you see your class photos, you recognize all of them at once! All those chubby or thin kids, ugly or cute looking kids are all different now.

**_THE DAY_**

Last day when you pack your bags, not knowing that you were packing all those memories of your school days. _"LAST GOODBYE"_

The last time you were actually living those moments but could not turn those moments into memories.

_You didn't even realize, when you walked out of that huge door of school, that it was a moment worth being engraved in your memories._
